# spacecrafts-program

This program presents the possibility of registering and simulating the use of spacecrafts.
The user must inform the name, type (battle or transport), number of seats and number of crew members.

Afterwards, the user is asked to choose between accelerating, changing, or printing the name and final speed of the spacecraft.
There is a static deceleration rate of 17% for every acceleration performed.

The technologies used to build this program were JavaScript and HTML.
